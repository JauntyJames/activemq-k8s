High availability for ActiveMQ with MDS and OKE
===============================================

Apache ActiveMQ is the most popular open source, multi-protocol, Java-based
message broker. It supports industry standard protocols so users get the
benefits of client choices across a broad range of languages and platforms. By
leveraging Oracle's MySQL Database Service as a persistence store, users can
employ AMQ as a cloud-native messaging platform for Kubernetes.
